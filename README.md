#ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Supriya â€” Engineer | Researcher | Builder
Welcome to my GitHub! This is where I share what Iâ€™ve been learning, building, and experimenting with across wireless systems, embedded platforms, and edge machine learning.

I come from a background that blends telecom engineering, hands-on embedded design, and academic research, and Iâ€™m always curious about how things work â€” whether it's optimizing beamforming algorithms, training a tinyML model for the edge, or prototyping firmware on a microcontroller.
